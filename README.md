## **Task 1: Iris Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis**

### **Objective**

To analyze the Iris dataset using statistical and visual methods to identify patterns, feature correlations, and species-specific characteristics.

### **Dataset Overview**

The dataset comprises measurements for three Iris species (**Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica**) across four features:

* **Sepal:** Length and Width
* **Petal:** Length and Width

### **Methodology**

1. **Environment:** Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib).
2. **Data Audit:** Verified data integrity, types, and null values.
3. **Visualization:** Utilized scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to map feature distributions and class separation.

### **Key Insights**

* **Data Quality:** The dataset is clean with zero missing values.
* **Feature Importance:** Petal measurements provide distinct clustering, making them superior predictors for species classification.
* **Class Overlap:** While Petal features show clear boundaries, Sepal features exhibit significant overlap between Versicolor and Virginica.
* **Modeling Readiness:** The clear linear separability of the Setosa species suggests the data is well-suited for classification algorithms.

### **Execution**

* Open the `.ipynb` file in a Jupyter environment.
* Execute cells sequentially to replicate the analysis.
